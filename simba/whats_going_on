job priority is by start time (from traces)
on submit time jobs move to wait queue
when there is a match jobs move to host and finish time is entered to event queue
when job is finished it is removed from host
collectors - 
	for each job:
		wait time
		run time
we can report it when job finish
	for each host:
		core used
		memory used
we will have an event (say each 5 minutes) that will check those		

TODO:
validate kelet (jobs hosts)
add to hosts collector: avg mem used (mean), stiyat teken (variance)
add to hosts collector: jobs in queue. completed jobs?
input files should not be hardcoded
allow parsing of other files (other traces)
change job length field to runTime
 

		
more comments (old bugs)		
handle test finish time on last submit/schedule - when no events in queue...
verify jobs can run on pool - throw them from simulation - ask zamir about parallel
negative job length		 - must be greater than 0. problem with iil_1 traces rounding
