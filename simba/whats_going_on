job priority is by start time (from traces)
on submit time jobs move to wait queue
when there is a match jobs move to host and finish time is entered to event queue
when job is finished it is removed from host
collectors - 
	for each job:
		wait time
		run time
we can report it when job finish
	for each host:
		core used
		memory used
we will have an event (say each 5 minutes) that will check those		

TODO:
ask zamir about parallel jobs
		
more comments (old bugs)		
handle test finish time on last submit/schedule - when no events in queue...
verify jobs can run on pool - throw them from simulation - ask zamir about parallel
negative job length		 - must be greater than 0. problem with iil_1 traces rounding
